        <h2>Feeding</h2>
        Depending on the age of your pet and its size feeding can look quite different. Here are some general guidelines:<br>
        Puppies eight to 12 weeks old need four meals a day.<br>
        Feed puppies three to six months old three meals a day.<br>
        Feed puppies six months to one year two meals a day.<br>
        When your dog reaches his first birthday, one meal a day is usually enough.<br>
        For some dogs, including larger canines or those prone to bloat, it's better to feed two smaller meals.<br>

        Make sure to read up on what dogs can and cannot eat at <a href="https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/nutrition/human-foods-dogs-can-and-cant-eat/"></a> . <br>
        If you're unsure or your dog starts expressing signs of illness and indigestion contact an animal medical professional as soon as possible.
        
        <h2>Grooming</h2>
        <h3>Brushing</h3><br>
        Regardless of breed, regular brushing will help keep your dog’s coat shiny and glossy. The amount of brushing per week depends on your dog’s coat length and texture. Longhaired breeds like golden retrievers and collies will need more frequent brushing (at least once a week, if not every other day), while shorthaired breeds like greyhounds or labradors may need a good brushing only every other week.
        <h3>Nail and hair trimming</h3>
        Trim your dog’s nails when you hear them clicking on the hard floors in your home. This will prevent your dog from experiencing discomfort from overly long nails. Here is a link with instructions on how to do that <a href="https://mypetandi.elanco.com/au/health/guide-cutting-your-dog-s-nails"></a><br><br>
        Always take care when trimming, and if you’re nervous or would prefer not to trim your dog’s hair yourself, turn to a professional grooming service.
        <h3>Washing</h3>

        If your dog has a healthy coat and normal skin, bathing no more than once a month is usually sufficient. Unless directed by your vet, do not bathe your dog more than once a week, as this can dry out their skin and damage their fur. <br>
        Use a shampoo formulated specifically for dogs. Avoid using human shampoos as these have too high of an acidity level for your dog's skin and coat. The pH balance of human skin is different from your dog's, and shampoos made for us can dry out their skin and coat and cause irritation from scents and other chemicals.
