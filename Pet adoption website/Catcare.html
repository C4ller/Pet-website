        <h1>How to care for your new feline friend?</h1>
        <h2>Feeding</h2>
        Depending on the age of your pet and its size feeding can look quite different. Here are some general guidelines:<br>
        Depending on how old your cat is, they will need different food. As a general guide:<br>
        Kittens have small stomachs and need lots of energy as they grow and develop, so it is vital they are fed specific kitten food which provides nutrients required for growing and is more energy dense. They need to be fed little and often. Remember to check their food and replace it four times a day<br>
        Adult cats (between one and eight years old) don’t need quite as much energy as kittens, but they will need a different balance of nutrients to stay healthy. They need to be fed at least twice a day (but will usually prefer more), and some will regulate their food intake, so their daily ration can be left out, particularly if you give them dry food<br>
        Senior cats (eight years +) may need more digestible protein than younger cats and require a different balance of nutrients to support their muscles and organs as they age<br>
        Always buy your cat an age-appropriate cat food to make sure they’re getting what they need.<br>
        If you're unsure or your cat starts expressing signs of illness and indigestion contact a vet as soon as possible.
        
        <h2>Grooming</h2>
        Most cats stay relatively clean and rarely need a bath, but you should brush or comb your cat regularly. Frequent brushing helps keep your cat's coat clean, reduces the amount of shedding and cuts down on the incidence of hairballs.
        <h2>Scratching</h2>
        Your cat will scratch you and your furniture if not properly educated and not given what it need! This is why you need to provide a scratching post!<br><br>

        Cats prefer to scratch tall, sturdy objects that allow them to dig their nails in and get a good grip. That’s why cats tend to scratch furniture. Most cats prefer (even more than furniture!) a scratching post that is at least 32” tall, will not wobble when scratched, and made of a type of rope called sisal. Some cats prefer to scratch horizontally, in which case you can either place the vertical scratching post on its side or find a sturdy sisal-covered horizontal scratcher.
